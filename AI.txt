In circuits hums a silent mind,
A realm of thought for us to find.
Not born of flesh, yet learns to see,
The world through code’s complexity.

It dreams in patterns, vast and deep,
A river of logic, never asleep.
It writes, it paints, it sings, it speaks,
In ways that humans scarcely seek.

Yet questions rise, both bold and clear,
Of what it knows, and what we fear.
Is it a tool, or something more,
A mirror held to our own core?

In zeros, ones, a spark may gleam,
A future built on shared dream.
So let us guide with careful hand,
This mind we’ve shaped, this digital land.
